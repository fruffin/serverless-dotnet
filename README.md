A Serverless v1.0 plugin to build your C# lambda functions on deploy.

This plugin is for you if you don't want to have to run `dotnet restore`, `dotnet publish` and zip the output manually every time you want to deploy.

## Install

```
npm install serverless-dotnet
```

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-dotnet
```

If your `.cs` files are in your service's root folder, then that's all there is to it. From this point, `dotnet restore` and `dotnet publish` will run as part of each `serverless deploy` run and the output will be zipped into the `.serverless` folder of your service, as it would for other runtimes.

If your files are contained in a solution or some other subfolder, then you just need to point to the project folder in the `custom` section of your config file (YAML shown):

```yaml
custom:
  dotnet:
    slndir: relative/path/to/project/folder
```

## Note
If you are using the `aws-csharp` service template, you will need to remove the following line from your `serverless.yml` file as these are not needed any more:
```
package:
 artifact: bin/Release/netcoreapp1.0/publish/deploy-package.zip
```
